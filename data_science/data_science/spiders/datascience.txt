Quantitative Analysts work all across the organization to help shape Google's business and technical strategies by processing, analyzing and interpreting huge data sets. Using analytical rigor and statistical methods, you mine through data to identify opportunities for Google and our clients to operate more efficiently, from enhancing advertising efficacy to network infrastructure optimization to studying user behavior. As an analyst, you do more than just crunch the numbers. You work with Engineers, Product Managers, Sales Associates and Marketing teams to adjust Google's practices according to your findings. Identifying the problem is only half the job; you also figure out the solution.",
               u"As a member of the Operations Decision Support team, you will lead cross-functional projects and drive mission-critical initiatives in the optimization of one of the world's largest and most powerful computing and networking infrastructures. You will work broadly across all groups supporting Google\u2019s network, to develop data-driven\xa0strategies and decision support tools to optimize the procurement, planning, delivery, and allocation of network capacity around the globe. You will be expected to think critically and strategically about Google as a business and as an operation, and absorb and process insane amounts of technical background on one of the most advanced computational infrastructures in the world. You will be expected to be equally comfortable proposing financial strategies to the CFO or discussing with engineers the technical and financial trade-offs involved in hardware design and deployment strategies.",
